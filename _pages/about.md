Hi! I'm a PhD student (24Fall) in Physics at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who is interested in Condensed Matter Theory, Quantum Information and Machine Learning. 

My B.S. degree in Physics is obtained at [Lanzhou University](http://phy.lzu.edu.cn/English.htm) (Gansu, China, 2020.09- 2024.06) and I was fortunate to achieve my Bachelor's thesis *Neural Quantum State with its Application in Variational Monte Carlo Method* under the supervision of [Prof. Yizhuang You](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=jXdbhiQAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Yin Zhong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yin-Zhong-4).

The main focus of my PhD study at UIUC right now is quantum error correction for LDPC (low density parity checker) codes. Also, I am committed to combine machine learning methods with decoding algorithms.
