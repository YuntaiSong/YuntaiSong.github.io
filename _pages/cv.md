Research experience
======
* Emergent Long-Range Interaction in Entanglement Hamiltonian
  
Period: Jul. 2023 - Sep. 2023

Institution: Hangzhou, China

Instructor: Prof. Zheng Yan

Responsibilities:

1.Utilized exact diagonalization for analyzing the 1D Heisenberg Ladder system.

2.Extracted the strength of Heisenberg operator across varying interaction distances within the entanglement Hamiltonian to challenge the Li-Haldane conjecture.

* Neural Quantum State Ansatz for Variational Monte Carlo Method

Period: Aug. 2023 - Apr. 2024

Institution: San Diego, USA

Instructor: Prof. Yizhuang You

Responsibilities:

1.Implemented Neural Jastrow correlator in VMC for determining the ground state of multi-flavor Fermion models.


2.Applied restricted Boltzmann machine ansatz in VMC for ground state calculations of various spin models, including the transverse Ising model and the Kitaev honeycomb model with a magnetic field.

3.Employed CNN and GCNN ansatz in VMC for ground state determination of frustrated spin models like the J_1-J_2 model.

* Monte Carlo Method for Quantum Error Correction

Period: Nov. 2023 - Present

Institution: Riverside, USA

Instructor: Prof. Leonid Pryadko

Responsibilities:

1.Developed a Monte Carlo method for the decoding process in quantum error correction.

2.Utilized the Bennett acceptance ratio method to identify the error vector with the lowest free energy.
